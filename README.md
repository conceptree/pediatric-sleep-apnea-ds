# Pediatric Sleep Apnea Project

This repository contains the research, data, and code for my master's thesis on **pediatric sleep apnea**, focusing on the application of machine learning to assist in the diagnosis of sleep disorders in children and adolescents (0–18 years).

## 📚 Project Overview

The goal of this thesis is to explore how machine learning models can be trained using **polysomnography reports** and **patient history** to improve diagnostic accuracy of **pediatric obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)** and related sleep disorders.

## 🧠 Key Objectives

- Collect and pre-process clinical and polysomnographic data.
- Perform literature review on existing diagnostic tools and ML approaches.
- Develop and evaluate predictive models using Python (e.g., scikit-learn, XGBoost).
- Analyze model performance and clinical relevance.
- Discuss ethical and privacy implications.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebooks
